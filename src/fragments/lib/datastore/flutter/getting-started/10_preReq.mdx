<Callout warning>

If you are using Flutter v2 and encountering build errors involving minimum deployment targets, you may need to update your app's `Podfile` in the `ios` directory.

You should update the `post_install` hook to include the following:

</Callout>

```diff
 post_install do |installer|
   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
     flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
+    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
+      config.build_settings.delete 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'
+    end
   end
 end
```
