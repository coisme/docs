With the basic setup complete, next you will model the data your application will store. Amplify DataStore will use this model to persist data to your local device and synchronize it to a backend API without writing any additional code. These models are specified as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) schemas. If you'd like, first [learn more](/cli/graphql-transformer/overview) about GraphQL schemas and data modeling.

1. Switch to **Project** view in Android Studio.

1. Expand the **Todo** folder and open the schema file located at **amplify** > **backend** > **api** > **amplifyDatasource** > **schema.graphql**.  

    Replace the contents of the file with the following schema:

    ```graphql
   enum Priority {
     LOW
     NORMAL
     HIGH
   }

   type Todo @model {
     id: ID!
     name: String!
     priority: Priority
     description: String
   }
    ```

    This schema creates a model called `Todo` with four properties:

    - **id** an auto-generated identifier field for a Todo item
    - **name** a non-optional string field that is the title of the Todo item
    - **priority** an optional enumeration type field that indicates the importance of a Todo item; the value of priority can be only *LOW*, *NORMAL*, or *HIGH*
    - **description** an optional string field that holds more information about a Todo item

1. Next, generate the classes for these models. In Android Studio, click the Gradle Task dropdown in the toolbar and select **modelgen**.

1. Run the task. You can do this by pressing the **play button** or pressing **Control-R**.
