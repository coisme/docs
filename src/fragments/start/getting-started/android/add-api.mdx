Now that your have DataStore persisting data locally, in the next step you'll connect it to the cloud. With a couple of commands, you'll create an AWS AppSync API and configure DataStore to synchronize its data to it.

1. Configure Amplify to manage cloud resources on your behalf. This step will configure a new AWS user in your account for Amplify. Open up a terminal window. You can use an external terminal or the integrated terminal in Android Studio. In the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    amplify configure
    ```

   This command will open up a web browser to the AWS Management Console and guide you through creating a new IAM user. For step-by-step directions to set this up, refer to the [CLI installation guide](/cli/start/install).

1. Next, push your new API to AWS. In Android Studio, click the Gradle Task dropdown in the toolbar and select **amplifyPush**.

1. Run the task. You can do this by pressing the **play button** or pressing **Control-R**.

1. Modify your initialization code so that the DataStore can sync with the backend through an API. Open `MainActivity`, and remove all of the code you added to `onCreate`. Replace it with the following:

  <BlockSwitcher>
  <CodeBlock name="Java">
  
  ```java
  try {
      Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSApiPlugin());
      Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSDataStorePlugin());
      Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());

      Log.i("Tutorial", "Initialized Amplify");
  } catch (AmplifyException failure) {
      Log.e("Tutorial", "Could not initialize Amplify", failure);
  }

  Amplify.DataStore.observe(Todo.class,
      started -> Log.i("Tutorial", "Observation began."),
      change -> Log.i("Tutorial", change.item().toString()),
      failure -> Log.e("Tutorial", "Observation failed.", failure),
      () -> Log.i("Tutorial", "Observation complete.")
  );
  ```

  </CodeBlock>

  <CodeBlock name="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  try {
      Amplify.addPlugin(AWSApiPlugin())
      Amplify.addPlugin(AWSDataStorePlugin())
      Amplify.configure(applicationContext)
      Log.i("Tutorial", "Initialized Amplify")
  } catch (failure: AmplifyException) {
      Log.e("Tutorial", "Could not initialize Amplify", failure)
  }

  Amplify.DataStore.observe(Todo::class.java,
      { Log.i("Tutorial", "Observation began.") },
      { Log.i("Tutorial", it.item().toString()) },
      { Log.e("Tutorial", "Observation failed.", it) },
      { Log.i("Tutorial", "Observation complete.") }
  )
  ```

  </CodeBlock>
  </BlockSwitcher>

1. In the Gradle Task dropdown menu in the toolbar, select **app** and run the application. This will synchronize the existing local Todo items to the cloud. `DataStore.observe` will log a message when new items are synchronized locally.

1. Open up a terminal window. You can use an external terminal or the integrated terminal in Android Studio. In the terminal, run:

   ```bash
   amplify console api
   ```

   ```console
   ? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: (Use arrow keys)
      `GraphQL`
   ```

1. The AWS Appsync service will open in the AWS Management Console. In the **Queries** window, paste the following query in the left pane:

    ```graphql
    query GetTodos {
        listTodos {
            items {
                id
                name
                priority
                description
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Press the **play button** to run the query. This will return all of the synchronized Todos in the right pane:

    ![](/images/lib/getting-started/android/set-up-appsync-query.png)

1. Synchronization will occur bi-directionally. Create an item in AWS AppSync by copying and pasting the following mutation:

    ```graphql
    mutation CreateTodo {
        createTodo(
            input: {
                name: "Tidy up the office"
                description: "Organize books, vacuum, take out the trash"
                priority: NORMAL
            }
        ) {
            id
            name
            description
            priority
            _version
            _lastChangedAt
        }
    }
```

    ![](/images/lib/getting-started/android/set-up-appsync-create.png)

1. In the logs of your running application, filter for **Tutorial**. You will see this item synchronize to your local storage:

    ```console
    com.example.todo I/Tutorial: Todo {id=b9fa0d33-873e-46f3-baa3-3148f6f47d44, name=Tidy up the office, priority=NORMAL, description=Organize books, vacuum, take out the trash}
    ```
