};



The Amplify CLI provides a guided workflow to easily add, develop, test and manage REST APIs to access your AWS resources from your web and mobile applications.

A REST API or HTTP endpoint will be composed by one or more paths. Eg: `/items`. Each path will use a Lambda function to handle HTTP requests and responses. Amplify CLI creates a single resource in Amazon API Gateway so you can handle all routes, HTTP Methods and paths, with a single Lambda function via a Lambda Proxy integration. HTTP proxy integrations forward all requests and responses directly through to your HTTP endpoint.

Amplify CLI let's you choose either an existing Lambda function or create a new one. To kickstart your implementation, you can choose between the following templates:

- Serverless ExpressJS function
- CRUD function for DynamoDB

> Lambda templates use [serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express) and provide the building blocks to start your REST API development.

> See the list of all [supported Lambda runtimes](/cli/function/function).

Amplify CLI allows you to restrict REST API access to

- Only authenticated users; or
- Authenticated and Guest users

See a description of these user types below
