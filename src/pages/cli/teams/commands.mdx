## Team workflows

Amplify environments help you manage your local and cloud environments to mimic your team workflows. Common tasks include:

- Manage environments to support development processes (e.g., development, staging, production)
- Test new features safely
- Share environments between team members
- Support team workflows

To display all commands available for a new Amplify project, run the following command from the root directory.

```bash
amplify env
```
