## @key

The `@key` directive makes it simple to configure custom index structures for `@model` types.

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale but making it work for your access patterns requires a bit of forethought. DynamoDB query operations may use at most two attributes to efficiently query data. The first query argument passed to a query (the hash key) must use strict equality and the second attribute (the sort key) may use gt, ge, lt, le, eq, beginsWith, and between. DynamoDB can effectively implement a wide variety of access patterns that are powerful enough for the majority of applications.

When modeling your data during schema design there are common patterns that you may need to leverage. [We provide a fully working schema with 17 patterns related to relational designs](/cli/graphql-transformer/dataaccess).
