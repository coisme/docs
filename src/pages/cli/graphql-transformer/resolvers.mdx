## Overwriting Resolvers

Let's say you have a simple *schema.graphql*...

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

and you want to change the behavior of request mapping template for the *Query.getTodo* resolver that will be generated when the project compiles. To do this you would create a file named `Query.getTodo.req.vtl` in the *resolvers* directory of your API project. The next time you run `amplify push` or `amplify api gql-compile`, your resolver template will be used instead of the auto-generated template. You may similarly create a `Query.getTodo.res.vtl` file to change the behavior of the resolver's response mapping template.

## Custom Resolvers

You can add custom `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription` when the generated ones do not cover your use case.
1. Add the required `Query`, `Mutation` or `Subscription` type to your schema.
2. Create resolvers for newly created `Query`, `Mutation` or `Subscription` by creating request and response template in `<project-root>/amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/resolvers` folder. Graphql Transformer follows `<TypeName>.<FieldName>.<req/res>.vlt` as convention to name the resolvers. So if you're adding a custom query name `myCustomQuery` the resolvers would be name `Query.myCustomQuery.req.vtl` and `Query.myCustomQuery.res.vtl`.
3. Add resolvers resource by creating a custom stack inside `<project-root>/amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/stacks` directory of your API.

To add the custom fields, add the following to your schema:

```graphql
  # <project-root>amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql

  type Query {
    # Add all the custom queries here
  }

  type Mutation {
    # Add all the custom mutations here
  }

  type Subscription {
    # Add all the custom subscription here
  }

```

The GraphQL Transformer by default creates a file called `CustomResources.json` inside `<project-root>/amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/stacks`, which can be used to add the custom resolvers for newly added `Query`, `Mutation` or `Subscription`. The custom stack gets the following arguments passed to it, allowing you to get details about API:

| Parameter                          | Type   | Possible values                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
