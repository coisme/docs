A simple way to add authentication flows into your app is to use the Authenticator component. The Authenticator component encapsulates an authentication workflow in the framework of your choice and is backed by the cloud resources set up in your Auth cloud resources.

import react_native from "/src/fragments/ui/auth/authenticator/react-native/authenticator.mdx";
import web_common from "/src/fragments/ui/auth/authenticator/web/authenticator.mdx";

<Fragments
  fragments={{
    react: web_common,
    angular: web_common,
    vue: web_common,
    ionic: web_common,
    "react-native": react_native,
  }}
/>
