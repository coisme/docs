## Amplify Console app project

Every Amplify Console app project consists of frontend and backend environments. Environments allow you to build new features for your app without impacting production.

### Frontend environments

All frontend environments are managed by Amplify Hosting. A frontend environment corresponds to a Git branch for apps with CI/CD enabled. Each branch is deployed to a unique url (e.g. `https://main.appid.amplifyapp.com`). Launch your hosted web app from each frontend environment, or view your deployment details.

### Backend environments

Each backend environment is a container for all of the cloud capabilities added to your app such as API, auth, and storage. Launch the Admin UI from each backend environment, or get to the underlying AWS service consoles.
